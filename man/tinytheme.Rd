\usage{
tinytheme(theme = NULL, ..., action = "replace")
}
\arguments{
\item{theme}{A character string specifying the name of the theme to apply.
If \code{NULL}, the tinyplot settings are re-initialized and the graphical device is closed. Available themes include:
\itemize{
\item \code{"bw"}
\item \code{"classic"}
\item \code{"dark"}
\item \code{"ipsum"}
\item \code{"minimal"}
}}

\item{...}{Named arguments to override specific theme settings. These arguments are
passed to \code{tpar()} and take precedence over the predefined settings in the selected
theme.}

\item{action}{"append", "prepend", or "replace" to the hook.}
}
\value{
The function returns nothing. It is called for its side effects.
}
\description{
The \code{tinytheme} function sets or resets the theme for plots created with
\code{tinyplot}. Themes control the appearance of plots, such as text alignment,
font styles, and axis labels. By default, a "bw" theme is available.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{setHook("before.plot.new", ...)} to apply the specified
theme settings just before a new plot is drawn. Themes are implemented
as a list of graphical parameters, which are passed to the \code{tpar} function.

To reset the theme to default settings (no customization), call \code{tinytheme(NULL)}.

\examples{
# Set a theme
tinytheme("bw")
tinyplot(mpg ~ hp | factor(am), data = mtcars)

# Customize the theme by overriding default settings
tinytheme("bw", fg = "blue", font.main = 2)
tinyplot(mpg ~ hp | factor(am), data = mtcars, main = "Hello World!")

# Reset the theme
tinytheme()
tinyplot(mpg ~ hp | factor(am), data = mtcars)

}
