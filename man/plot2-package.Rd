\title{plot2: Lightweight extension of the base R plot function, with support
  for automatic grouping and legend printing, and several other enhancements}
\description{
The goal of **plot2** is to extend the functionality of base R's
  default (2D) `plot()` function, particularly as it applies to scatter and
  line plots with grouped data. For example, **plot2** makes it easy to plot
  different categories of a dataset in a single function call and highlight
  these categories (groups) using modern colour palettes. Coincident with
  this grouping support, **plot2** also produces automatic legends with scope
  for further customization. While the package also offers several other
  minor enhancements, it tries as far as possible to be a drop-in replacement
  for the equivalent base plot function. Users should be able to swap a valid
  `plot` call with `plot2` without any changes to the expected output.
