\title{Histogram type}
\usage{
type_histogram(breaks = "Sturges")

type_hist(breaks = "Sturges")
}
\arguments{
\item{breaks}{Passed to \code{\link[graphics]{hist}}. One of:
\itemize{
\item a vector giving the breakpoints between histogram cells,
\item a function to compute the vector of breakpoints,
\item a single number giving the number of cells for the histogram,
\item a character string naming an algorithm to compute the number of cells (see ‘Details’ of \code{\link[graphics]{hist}}),
\item a function to compute the number of cells.
In the last three cases the number is a suggestion only; as the breakpoints
will be set to pretty values, the number is limited to 1e6 (with a warning if
it was larger). If breaks is a function, the x vector is supplied to it as
the only argument (and the number of breaks is only limited by the amount of
available memory).
