\title{Ridge plot type}
\usage{
type_ridge(scale = 1.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{scale}{Numeric. Controls the scaling factor of each plot.
Values greater than 1 means that plots overlap.}
}
\description{
Type function for producing ridge plots (also known as joy plots),
which display density distributions for multiple groups with vertical offsets.
This function uses \code{tinyplot} scaffolding, which enables added functionality
such as grouping and faceting.

The line color is controlled by the \code{col} argument in the \code{tinyplot()} call.
The fill color is controlled by the \code{bg} argument in the \code{tinyplot()} call.
}
\examples{
tinyplot(Species ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris, type = "ridge")

tinyplot(Month ~ Ozone,
  data = airquality,
  type = type_ridge(scale = 1),
  bg = "light blue", col = "black")

}
