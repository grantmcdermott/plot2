\arguments{
\item{bw}{the smoothing bandwidth to be used.  The kernels are scaled
    such that this is the standard deviation of the smoothing kernel.
    (Note this differs from the reference books cited below.)

    \code{bw} can also be a character string giving a rule to choose the
    bandwidth.  See \code{\link[stats]{bw.nrd}}. \cr The default,
    \code{"nrd0"}, has remained the default for historical and
    compatibility reasons, rather than as a general recommendation,
    where e.g., \code{"SJ"} would rather fit, see also
    Venables and Ripley (2002).

    The specified (or computed) value of \code{bw} is multiplied by
    \code{adjust}.
  }

\item{joint.bw}{character string indicating whether (and how) the smoothing
bandwidth should be computed from the joint data distribution when there
are multiple subgroups. The options are \code{"mean"} (the default), \code{"full"},
and \code{"none"}. See the "Bandwidth selection" section below for details.}

\item{adjust}{the bandwidth used is actually \code{adjust*bw}.
    This makes it easy to specify values like \sQuote{half the default}
    bandwidth.}

\item{kernel}{a character string giving the smoothing kernel to be used. This
must partially match one of \code{"gaussian"}, \code{"rectangular"}, \code{"triangular"},
\code{"epanechnikov"}, \code{"biweight"}, \code{"cosine"} or \code{"optcosine"}, with default
\code{"gaussian"}, and may be abbreviated to a unique prefix (single letter).

\code{"cosine"} is smoother than \code{"optcosine"}, which is the usual 'cosine'
kernel in the literature and almost MSE-efficient. However, \code{"cosine"} is
the version used by S.}

\item{n}{the number of equally spaced points at which the density is
    to be estimated.  When \code{n > 512}, it is rounded up to a power
    of 2 during the calculations (as \code{\link[stats]{fft}} is used) and the
    final result is interpolated by \code{\link[stats]{approx}}.  So it almost
    always makes sense to specify \code{n} as a power of two.
  }

\item{alpha}{numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the opacity of ribbon shading
If no \code{alpha} value is provided, then will default to \code{tpar("ribbon.alpha")}
(i.e., probably \code{0.2} unless this has been overridden by the user in their global
settings.)}

\description{
Type function for density plots.
}
\details{
The algorithm used in \code{density.default} disperses the mass of the
  empirical distribution function over a regular grid of at least 512
  points and then uses the fast Fourier transform to convolve this
  approximation with a discretized version of the kernel and then uses
  linear approximation to evaluate the density at the specified points.

  The statistical properties of a kernel are determined by
  \eqn{\sigma^2_K = \int t^2 K(t) dt}{sig^2 (K) = int(t^2 K(t) dt)}
  which is always \eqn{= 1} for our kernels (and hence the bandwidth
  \code{bw} is the standard deviation of the kernel) and
  \eqn{R(K) = \int K^2(t) dt}{R(K) = int(K^2(t) dt)}.\cr
  MSE-equivalent bandwidths (for different kernels) are proportional to
  \eqn{\sigma_K R(K)}{sig(K) R(K)} which is scale invariant and for our
  kernels equal to \eqn{R(K)}.  This value is returned when
  \code{give.Rkern = TRUE}.  See the examples for using exact equivalent
  bandwidths.

  Infinite values in \code{x} are assumed to correspond to a point mass at
  \code{+/-Inf} and the density estimate is of the sub-density on
  \code{(-Inf, +Inf)}.
}
\section{Bandwidth selection}{
 While the choice of smoothing bandwidth will
always stand to affect a density visualization, it gains an added
importance when multiple densities are drawn simultaneously (e.g., for
subgroups with respect to \code{by} or \code{facet}). Allowing each subgroup to
compute its own separate bandwidth independently offers greater flexibility
in capturing the unique characteristics of each subgroup, particularly when
distributions differ substantially in location and/or scale. However, this
approach may overemphasize small random variations and make it harder to
visually compare densities across subgroups. Hence, it is often useful to
employ the same ("joint") bandwidth across all subgroups. The following
strategies are available via the \code{joint.bw} argument:
\itemize{
\item The default \code{joint.bw = "mean"} first computes the individual bandwidths
for each group but then computes their mean, weighted by the number of
observations in each group. This will work well when all groups have
similar amounts of scatter (similar variances), even when they have
potentially rather different locations. The weighted averaging stabilizes
potential fluctuations in the individual bandwidths, especially when some
subgroups are rather small.
\item Alternatively, \code{joint.bw = "full"} can be used to compute the joint
bandwidth from the full joint distribution (merging all groups). This will
yield an even more robust bandwidth, especially when the groups overlap
substantially (i.e., have similar locations and scales). However, it may
lead to too large bandwidths and thus too much smoothing, especially when
the locations of the groups differ substantially.
\item Finally, \code{joint.bw = "none"} disables the joint bandwidth so that each
group just employs its individual bandwidth. This is often the best choice
if the amounts of scatter differ substantially between the groups, thus
necessitating different amounts of smoothing.

\section{Titles}{
 This tinyplot method for density plots differs from the base
\code{\link[stats]{plot.density}} function in its treatment of titles. The
x-axis title displays only the variable name, omitting details about the
number of observations and smoothing bandwidth. Additionally, the main
title is left blank by default for a cleaner appearance.
