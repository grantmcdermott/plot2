\usage{
type_density(
  bw = "nrd0",
  adjust = 1,
  kernel = c("gaussian", "epanechnikov", "rectangular", "triangular", "biweight",
    "cosine", "optcosine"),
  n = 512,
  joint.bw = c("none", "full", "owm"),

}
\arguments{
\item{bw}{the smoothing bandwidth to be used.  The kernels are scaled
    such that this is the standard deviation of the smoothing kernel.
    (Note this differs from the reference books cited below.)

    \code{bw} can also be a character string giving a rule to choose the
    bandwidth.  See \code{\link[stats]{bw.nrd}}. \cr The default,
    \code{"nrd0"}, has remained the default for historical and
    compatibility reasons, rather than as a general recommendation,
    where e.g., \code{"SJ"} would rather fit, see also
    Venables and Ripley (2002).

    The specified (or computed) value of \code{bw} is multiplied by
    \code{adjust}.
  }

\item{adjust}{the bandwidth used is actually \code{adjust*bw}.
    This makes it easy to specify values like \sQuote{half the default}
    bandwidth.}

\item{kernel}{a character string giving the smoothing kernel to be used. This
must partially match one of \code{"gaussian"}, \code{"rectangular"}, \code{"triangular"},
\code{"epanechnikov"}, \code{"biweight"}, \code{"cosine"} or \code{"optcosine"}, with default
\code{"gaussian"}, and may be abbreviated to a unique prefix (single letter).

\code{"cosine"} is smoother than \code{"optcosine"}, which is the usual 'cosine'
kernel in the literature and almost MSE-efficient. However, \code{"cosine"} is
the version used by S.}

\item{n}{the number of equally spaced points at which the density is
    to be estimated.  When \code{n > 512}, it is rounded up to a power
    of 2 during the calculations (as \code{\link[stats]{fft}} is used) and the
    final result is interpolated by \code{\link[stats]{approx}}.  So it almost
    always makes sense to specify \code{n} as a power of two.
  }

\item{joint.bw}{character string indicating whether (and how) the smoothing
bandwidth should be computed from the joint data distribution. The default
value of \code{"none"} means that bandwidths will be computed independently for
each data subgroup. Choosing \code{"full"} will result in a joint bandwidth
computed from the full distribution. Similarly, \code{"owm"} will compute the
joint bandwidth as the observation-weighted mean of the individual subgroup
bandwidths. Note that the \code{joint.bw} argument is only relevant for grouped
or faceted density plots.}

\item{alpha}{numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the opacity of ribbon shading
If no \code{alpha} value is provided, then will default to \code{tpar("ribbon.alpha")}
(i.e., probably \code{0.2} unless this has been overridden by the user in their global
settings.)}

\description{
Type function for density plots.
}
\details{
The algorithm used in \code{density.default} disperses the mass of the
  empirical distribution function over a regular grid of at least 512
  points and then uses the fast Fourier transform to convolve this
  approximation with a discretized version of the kernel and then uses
  linear approximation to evaluate the density at the specified points.

  The statistical properties of a kernel are determined by
  \eqn{\sigma^2_K = \int t^2 K(t) dt}{sig^2 (K) = int(t^2 K(t) dt)}
  which is always \eqn{= 1} for our kernels (and hence the bandwidth
  \code{bw} is the standard deviation of the kernel) and
  \eqn{R(K) = \int K^2(t) dt}{R(K) = int(K^2(t) dt)}.\cr
  MSE-equivalent bandwidths (for different kernels) are proportional to
  \eqn{\sigma_K R(K)}{sig(K) R(K)} which is scale invariant and for our
  kernels equal to \eqn{R(K)}.  This value is returned when
  \code{give.Rkern = TRUE}.  See the examples for using exact equivalent
  bandwidths.

  Infinite values in \code{x} are assumed to correspond to a point mass at
  \code{+/-Inf} and the density estimate is of the sub-density on
  \code{(-Inf, +Inf)}.

\section{Titles}{
 This tinyplot method for density plots differs from the base
\code{\link[stats]{plot.density}} function in its treatment of titles. The
x-axis title displays only the variable name, omitting details about the
number of observations and smoothing bandwidth. Additionally, the main
title is left blank by default for a cleaner appearance.
