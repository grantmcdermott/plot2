A lightweight extension of the base R `plot` function, with support for
automatic grouping and legend handling, and several other enhancements.

## Installation

**plot2** is not yet on CRAN, but can be installed from R-universe.

``` r
install.packages("plot2", repos = "https://grantmcdermott.r-universe.dev")
```

## Motivation

R users are spoiled for choice when it comes to visualization frameworks. The
options of course include **ggplot2** (arguably the most important graphics
system of the last decade) and **lattice**, not to mention a bewildering array
of extensions built around, on top of, and in between these amazing packages.

It is perhaps not surprising, then, that the base R graphics system sometimes
gets short shrift. This is unfortunate, because base R offers very powerful and
flexible plotting facilities. Just type `demo(graphics)` or `demo(persp)` into
your R console to get an idea. Or, take a look at
[these](https://github.com/karoliskoncevicius/tutorial_r_introduction/blob/main/baseplotting.md)
[two](https://quizzical-engelbart-d15a44.netlify.app/2021-2022_m2-data-2_visu-2_practice#1)
excellent tutorials. The downside of this power and flexibility is that base R
plotting can require a fair bit of manual tinkering. A case in point is
plotting grouped data with an appropriate legend. Doing so with the generic
`plot()` function can require several function calls or a loop, fiddling with
your plot regions, and then generating the legend manually.

The **plot2** package aims to remove this overhead. It provides a lightweight
extension of the base R plot system with various convenience features,
particularly for creating (2D) scatter and line plots using grouped data. For
example, the core `plot2()` function makes it easy to plot different categories
of a dataset in a single function call and highlight these categories (groups)
using modern colour palettes. Coincident with this grouping support, `plot2()`
also produces automatic legends with scope for further customization. While the
package offers several other enhancements, it tries as far as possible to be a
drop-in replacement for the equivalent base plot function. Users should
(generally) be able to swap a valid `plot()` call with `plot2()` without any
changes to the expected output.

## Examples

Let's load the package then walk through some examples.

```{r}
library(plot2)
```

As far as possible, `plot2` tries to be a drop-in replacement for regular `plot`
calls.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

plot(0:10, main = "plot")
plot2(0:10, main = "plot2")
```

Similarly, we can plot elements from a data frame using either the atomic or
formula methods.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

plot(airquality$Day, airquality$Temp, main = "plot")
plot(Temp ~ Day, data = airquality, main = "plot (formula)")
plot2(airquality$Day, airquality$Temp, main = "plot2")
plot2(Temp ~ Day, data = airquality, main = "plot2 (formula)")

dev.off() # reset to default (single) plot window
```

So far, so good. But where `plot2` starts to diverge from its base counterpart is
with respect to grouped data. In particular, `plot2` allows you to characterize
groups using the `by` argument.^[At this point, experienced base plot users 
might protest that you _can_ colour by groups using the `col` argument, e.g.
`plot(airquality$Day, airquality$Temp, col = airquality$Month)`. This is true,
but there are several limitations. First, you don't get an automatic legend.
Second, the base `plot` formula method doesn't specify the grouping within the
formula itself (not a deal-breaker, but not particularly consistent in my view).
Third, and perhaps most importantly, this grouping doesn't carry over to line
plots (i.e., type="l"). Instead, you have to transpose your data and use
`mplot`. See
[this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10519873/how-to-create-a-line-plot-with-groups-in-base-r-without-loops)
old StackOverflow thread for a longer discussion.]

```{r}
plot2(airquality$Day, airquality$Temp, by = airquality$Month)
```

Notice that we also get an automatic legend. We'll return to legend
customization shortly.

An even more convenient approach is to use the equivalent formula syntax. Just
place the grouping variable after a vertical bar (i.e., `|`).

```{r}
plot2(Temp ~ Day | Month, airquality)
```

Converting to a grouped line plot is a simple matter of adjusting the `type`
argument. I'll also use this as an opportunity to highlight that the legend
responds to these plot element changes accordingly and can be further
customized. Note the use of the "!" in the `legend.position` argument to place
the legend _outside_ the plot area.

```{r}
plot2( 
  Temp ~ Day | Month, airquality,
  type = "l",
  legend.position = "right!"
)
```

Let's discuss colour palettes briefly. The default group colours in `plot2` are
either "Okabe-Ito" or "Viridis", depending on the number of groups. But this is
easily changed via the `palette` argument. Note that all palettes listed by
`palette.pals()` and `hcl.pals()` are supported out-of-the-box.^[See the
accompanying help pages of those functions for more details, or read the
[article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04918.pdf) by Achim Zeileis and Paul
Murrell.] Just pass on an appropriate palette name as a string.

```{r}
plot2(
  Temp ~ Day | Month, airquality,
  type = "l",
  legend.position = "right!",
  palette = "Tableau 10"
)
```

Customizing your plots further is fairly straightforward. For example, the
accompanying `legend.args` and `palette.args` arguments allow you to turn off 
the legend title and bounding box, switch the direction of the text, add 
transparency to your colour palette, etc. etc. Here's a quick penultimate
example, where we also show off `plot2`'s enhanced `grid` argument.

```{r}
par(family = "HersheySans") # Use one of R's built-in Hershey fonts instead of Arial default

plot2(
  Temp ~ Day | Month, airquality,
  type = "b", pch = 16,
  grid = grid(), frame.plot = FALSE,
  legend.position = "right!", legend.args = list(bty = "n"),
  palette = "Tableau 10", palette.args = list(alpha = 0.5)
)
```

The use of `par` (to set the font family) in the above example again underscores
the correspondence with the base graphics system. Because `plot2` is effectively
a convenience wrapper around base `plot`, any global elements that you have set
for the latter should carry over to the former. For nice out-of-the-box themes,
I recommend the **basetheme** package.

```{r}
par(family = "") # revert global font change from above

library(basetheme)
basetheme("royal") # or "clean", "dark", "ink", "brutal", etc.

plot2(
  Temp ~ Day | Month, airquality,
  type = "b", pch = 15:19,
  legend.position = "right!", legend.args = list(bty = "n"),
  palette = "Tropic"
)

basetheme(NULL)  # back to default theme
```

In summary, consider the **plot2** package if you are looking for base R `plot`
functionality with some additional convenience features. You can use pretty much
the same syntax and all of your theming elements should carry over too. It has
no dependencies other than base R itself and this makes it an attractive option
for situations where dependency management is expensive (e.g., an R application 
running in a browser via [WebAssembly](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/).)
