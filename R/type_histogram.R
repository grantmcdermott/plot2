#' Histogram type
#' 
#' @md
#' @description Type function for histogram plots. `type_hist` is an alias for
#'   `type_histogram`.
#' @param breaks Passed to \code{\link[graphics]{hist}}. One of:
#' - a vector giving the breakpoints between histogram cells,
#' - a function to compute the vector of breakpoints,
#' - a single number giving the number of cells for the histogram,
#' - a character string naming an algorithm to compute the number of cells (see ‘Details’ of \code{\link[graphics]{hist}}),
#' - a function to compute the number of cells.
#' In the last three cases the number is a suggestion only; as the breakpoints
#' will be set to pretty values, the number is limited to 1e6 (with a warning if
#' it was larger). If breaks is a function, the x vector is supplied to it as
#' the only argument (and the number of breaks is only limited by the amount of
#' available memory).
